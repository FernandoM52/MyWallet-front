Some Observations about this App

1. There is a feature on the main screen that shows the user's initial/total money, but it is fixed. So the value is not being calculated dynamically.


## Why

My Wallet was my first Full-Stack project. It was also my second project using a non-relational database, which was a topic I was studying at the time and for that I found the choice of MongoDB interesting.

So, I'm very grateful to made it and share this project, hope be very useful to you. Enjoy!
